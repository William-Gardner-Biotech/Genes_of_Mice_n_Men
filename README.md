<u>Which genes are conserved between <i>Homo sapiens</i> and <i>Mus musculus</i> and can be used to study human disease? Specifically, which genes can we study in a mouse model to research human cerebellum function and disease?</u>

Mice and humans share approximately 70% of the same protein-coding sequences (with protein coding sequences making up approximately 1.5% of each respective 3 billion base pair genome). This, along with fast reproduction, ease of care, and having short life spans, make mice a powerful test subject to use for furthering our understanding of complex human genetic diseases. Therefore, in order to maintain the progress made in research in gene annotation and novel drug discovery it is vital to find orthologous regions of DNA between mice and humans. Exploring differences between gene transcription across species may also help us to understand disease formation and mechanisms.[1][2]

Orthologous genes are the result of genes conserved between two species after a divergent event from a common ancestor. According to Nature[3] only 1% of human genes do not have a mouse ortholog, and between those orthologous genes is an average sequence similarity of 78.5%. If the goal is to utilize the mouse genome to make novel discoveries in realizing how a certain gene is playing its part in disease/function, it would be beneficial to know which genes share the highest sequence and tissue expression similarity. 

One of the anatomical areas that can be researched between humans and mice is the brain, more specifically the cerebellum, not only due to the aforementioned genetic similarities but also the anatomical resemblance. The cerebellum is located at the back of the head near where the spinal cord connects, and helps to coordinate and regulate a wide range of functions and processes in both your brain and body. [8] A disorder in the cerebellum can have effects such as; types of ataxia (failure of muscle control), brain degeneration, and cancer. The answer to what causes the development of such diseases/function may one day be found on the microscopic level of DNA, but first we must find the orthologs.
